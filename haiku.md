Hello World
In the morning mist,
Silent hills stretch to the sky,
Nature awakens.
Bird chip and flatter
Drew drops glisten on pertals
Life begins anew
A gentle breeze blows,
Carrying scents of spring blooms,
A fresh start unfolds.
The gentle breeze blows,
Cherry blossoms sway and dance,
Springtime has arrived
Goodbye world
